# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# This file contains all common constraints for edx-repos
-c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/edx-lint/master/edx_lint/files/common_constraints.txt

# pytest>=5.6.0 fails to fetch the tests and hence all the tests fail
pytest<5.6.0

pytest-xdist<2.0.0

# pytest (from `test.in`) requires pluggy<1.
# We must constrain it here so that `ci.in` (which doesn't
# include pytest) doesn't generate `ci.txt` with a pluggy version >=1. 
# Remove this pin when pytest no longer requires pluggy<1.
pluggy<1
